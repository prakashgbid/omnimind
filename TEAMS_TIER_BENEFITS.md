## 🎯 How to Maximize Your Teams Tier

### 1. Parallel Task Processing
```python
from src.agents.specialized.claude_opus_teams_agent import ClaudeOpusTeamsAgent

agent = ClaudeOpusTeamsAgent()

# Process 5 complex tasks simultaneously!
tasks = [
    {'id': 'security', 'prompt': 'Full security audit of codebase'},
    {'id': 'performance', 'prompt': 'Performance optimization analysis'},
    {'id': 'architecture', 'prompt': 'Architecture review and recommendations'},
    {'id': 'documentation', 'prompt': 'Generate comprehensive documentation'},
    {'id': 'testing', 'prompt': 'Create complete test suite'}
]

# All processed in parallel with Teams tier!
results = agent.parallel_analysis(tasks)
```

### 2. Massive Document Analysis
```python
# Analyze entire books, codebases, or documentation
with open('massive_codebase.txt', 'r') as f:
    huge_doc = f.read()  # Can be 200k+ tokens!

analysis = agent.massive_document_analysis(
    huge_doc,
    analysis_type="security_audit"
)
```

### 3. Priority Critical Tasks
```python
# Emergency? Your request jumps to front of queue
response = agent.priority_critical_task(
    "Production is down! Need immediate debugging help",
    deadline="ASAP"
)
```

### 4. Multi-Agent Orchestration
```python
# Coordinate multiple specialist agents simultaneously
result = agent.orchestrate_multi_agent(
    agents=['security', 'frontend', 'backend', 'devops', 'database'],
    task="Design complete enterprise system architecture"
)
```

### 5. Extended Learning Sessions
```python
# Run long, uninterrupted analysis sessions
deep_analysis = agent.continuous_learning_session(
    topic="Quantum computing applications in cryptography",
    duration="extended"  # No timeouts with Teams tier
)
```
